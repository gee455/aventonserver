If you're trying to sign up for a new Uber account and finding that your email address or mobile number is already registered, it's possible that another account incorrectly has your information associated with it.

If you don't currently have an Uber account, please send a message to support@uber.com with your information so that we may look into it.

If you have an Uber account but are unable to update your information, select "I can't change my email or mobile number".
