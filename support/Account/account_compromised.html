- seeing trip requests on your Destoto Cabs account that you are not making
- seeing completed trips on your Destoto Cabs account that you did not request
- receiving phone calls or text messages from drivers to pick you up when you did not request a trip
- receiving receipts for trips on your Destoto Cabs account that you did not request
- your account information being changed without your knowledge
- being unable to log into your account or the email address that was on your account is no longer found.
