All Uber accounts must have an email address and verified mobile number associated with the account in order to request a ride.

If you're trying to change your email or mobile number on an existing account but receiving an 'already registered' error, please let us know your correct information below.

If you're unable to sign up for a new account because your number is already registered, visit "My email or phone number is in use".
