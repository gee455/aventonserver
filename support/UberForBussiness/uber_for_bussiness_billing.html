When you sign up with Uber for Business, you’re asked to provide a credit card. We’ll create a payment profile that your employees can use to request rides from their own Uber accounts; all fares will be charged directly to the company’s card on file on a per-trip basis.

Employees will see the payment display name (e.g., “Company Card”) when they select their billing option within the Uber app. Credit card details will never be shared or shown with the rider.

In order to verify your payment method for Uber for Business, we issue a $250 USD authorization hold. This amount is never actually charged to your account, but you may see it as “pending” on


statements.
