Each employee associated with your Uber for Business account will need their own personal Uber account to use the service.

Adding employees to your Uber for Business account is quick and easy. Navigate to the dashboard and click “Add Employees,” located in top right-hand corner of the page. From there, you can add individual employees or use our bulk uploading feature to add a list of employees all at once using a .csv.

To remove an employee, go to the Employees tab in your dashboard, then check the box next to the name of the employee you’d like to remove and click the small trash can icon near the top of the page. Once removed, employees will no longer show up in your dashboard and they will no longer have access to your company’s credit card within the Uber app.
