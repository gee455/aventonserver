Once your company's Uber for Business account has been added to your account, you’ll see multiple payment options in your app. Selecting your company's Uber for Business payment profile is easy — just follow these steps:

1. Set your pickup location
2. Tap the payment source that is displayed below the map
3. Select your company's Uber for Business account

If you do not specify which payment source you’d like to pay with, we’ll automatically charge the last card or account you used.

If you accidentally selected the wrong payment method (e.g., your personal card instead of your company’s Uber For Business account) for a recent ride, select your trip from Trips menu and select "I used the wrong payment method."
