Uber for Business can be used at regular Uber rates. There is no corporate discount (or additional fee) that comes with the use of it.

By using the platform, you will be able to monitor your employee's travels with complete transparency, export trip data, and hopefully eliminate the need to reimburse or have employees submit travel receipts.

Uber is 30%-40% less than a TAXI in most major markets and will beat most all corporate negotiated Black Car services' rates.

You can find the Uber rates for all cities at the link below.
