You can sign up your organization for Uber for Business from the page linked below.

Neither Uber for Business account admins or employees that already use Uber need to create new Uber account to use Uber for Business. Existing Uber accounts are already set up.

Once an admin signs up or an employee is added to a business they simply verify their account by logging in with their personal Uber account credentials, from there the Uber for Business shared payment source will be added to their Uber app to pay for their business rides.
