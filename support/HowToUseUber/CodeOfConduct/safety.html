The safety of riders and drivers on the Pound Cabs platform is of utmost concern. In order to best protect everyone in the vehicle, we require the following:

Compliance with the law
Illegal substances and open containers of alcohol are not permitted in drivers vehicles. This is against the law and a serious violation of Pound Cabs policy. Furthermore, Pound Cabs does not tolerate drug or alcohol by drivers while using the Pound Cabs app. If a rider believes a driver may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, please request that the driver end the trip immediately and alert Pound Cabs Support.

As a driver, it is your responsibility to transport riders safely in accordance with the rules of the road in your city. As a rider, it is your responsibility to abide by the seat belt laws in your state. However, we recommend that you always wear a seatbelt while riding in any vehicle.

Disabilities
Pound Cabs expects compliance with all state, federal and local laws governing the transportation of riders with disabilities. Violation of these laws, including with respect to the use of service animals, constitutes a breach of the parties licensing agreement. Service animals must be accommodated in compliance with accessibility laws. Reports of refusing to transport a rider with a service animal will lead to deactivation of the Pound Cabs account.

Following the rules
We require partners to keep documents up to date to remain active. Riders, likewise, must maintain active payment information.

Riders are responsible for guests traveling with them or anyone they request a ride for. It is your responsibility to ensure everyone adheres to Pound Cabs Code of Conduct.

Violations of this Code of Conduct could result in loss of your Pound Cabs Account. Please report any violations to Pound Cabs. We want to hear your feedback so please alert us and we will take action.
