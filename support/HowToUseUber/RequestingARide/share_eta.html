You can share your arrival time with friends to let them know you are on your way. Once you have requested a ride:

- On iOS, tap the arrow next to your drivers information. On Android, tap the Share my ETA button at the top of your screen.
- Select Share my ETA

The app will draft a text message for you with the link to share your ETA.
