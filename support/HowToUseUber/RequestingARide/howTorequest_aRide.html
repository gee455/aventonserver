We automatically use GPS and Wi-Fi to set your pickup location. You may also enter an exact address or search for a venue name by tapping the pickup location bar.

Select from the available vehicle options by using the slider at the bottom of the map. Tapping on any of the icons will display rates for that option.

Once you have set your location and vehicle option, tap Set Pickup Location to request your ride.
