If you're an Pound Cabs rider using Apple Watch, you can request a ride directly from your wrist and receive a notification when your driver arrives.

The Apple Watch app will be set to your last selected vehicle option and payment method, and your pickup location will be set based on your GPS location. If you need to change these settings before you request, you should open the Pound Cabs app on your iPhone.

Some features  including Pound CabsPOOL, Split Fare, Share my ETA, and Contact Driver  are not available from Apple Watch at this time.
