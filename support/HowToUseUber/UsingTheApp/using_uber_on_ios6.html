In order to keep the Pound Cabs app running smoothly and prevent bugs from interfering with your experience, we've discontinued support for iOS 6. Don't worry, you can still get a ride  just follow the instructions below.

If you have an iPhone 5 or newer:
- Go into iPhone's Settings app, then tap General
- Tap Software Update to download iOS 8
- Once you have iOS 8, you can get the latest Pound Cabs app by going to the App Store and checking for Updates

If you're not ready to update your OS or are using an iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, or older, you can use Pound Cabs from the mobile website linked here.
