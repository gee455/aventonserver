From the beginning, we�ve always been committed to connecting you with the safest rides on the road.The Safe Rides Fee is a fee added to uberX fares on behalf of drivers (who may pay this fee to Pound Cabs) in cities with uberX ridesharing. This Safe Rides Fee supports continued efforts to ensure the safest possible platform for Pound Cabs riders and drivers, including a Federal, state, and local background check process, regular motor vehicle checks, driver safety education, development of safety features in the app, and more. For complete pricing transparency, you�ll see this as a separate line item on every uberX receipt.

In the U.S., the Safe Rides Fee is $1 USD. In Canada, it is $1 CAD.
