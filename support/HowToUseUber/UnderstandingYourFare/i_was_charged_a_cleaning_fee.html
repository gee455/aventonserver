The drivers that we partner with work hard to maintain clean vehicles.

A clean up fee for cosmetic or physical damage to the interior or exterior of the vehicle incurred as a result of events such as vomiting or pet accidents will be assessed and charged when applicable.

In most cases, this fee will be between $50 and $200, but the exact amount depends on the extent of the damage. You will always receive an updated receipt with an explanation when this fee is being charged.
