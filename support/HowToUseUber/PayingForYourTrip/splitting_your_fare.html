Split Fare allows you to seamlessly split the cost of your ride with those in your party.

Once you have requested your ride:

- Tap the arrow next to your driver's information
- Select Split Fare

Those you invited will be prompted with a notification to accept your Fare Split.

If the invited riders do not accept the Fare Split invitation or don't have a valid payment method, the ride requester will be responsible for their portion of the fare.
