We suggest requesting your ride once you've collected your bags from baggage claim and are ready to step outside.

You should expect to receive a call or message from your driver to confirm your pickup location (terminal, door number, etc).

Please note that drivers are unable to leave their vehicles unattended at airport terminals. As such, airport pickups are available curbside only.

Some cities offer flat rate fares to/from airports. Pricing details are available at the link below.
