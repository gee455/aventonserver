Before you request, we show the estimated time of arrival for the nearest available driver.

Often there’s large volume of requests happening simultaneously, which means your ETA may change depending on which driver you're connected with.

If the confirmed ETA doesn’t meet your needs, you can cancel within five minutes of your initial request without a fee.
