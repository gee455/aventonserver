Most drivers are happy to accommodate pets, but ultimately the decision is theirs.

If you'd like to travel with your pet, we suggest calling your driver as soon as your request is confirmed to coordinate. We recommend bringing along a crate or bag to minimize any mess.

Please note: all drivers are required by law to transport registered service animals. If you experience issues using Pound Cabs with your service animal, please reach out to us by reporting an issue with your trip.
