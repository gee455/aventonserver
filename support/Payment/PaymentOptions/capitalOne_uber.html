Capital One cardholders who are new to Uber can sign up using promo code CAPITALONE before June 30, 2015 to receive their first and second ride free (up to $30 per ride). Both rides must be taken before April 30, 2016 and be paid for with an eligible US-issued Capital One debit or credit card.

Corporate and private label cards are not eligible for this promotion. Additionally this offer is not valid for uberTAXI rides and can't be combined with other promo codes or offers.

In addition, any Uber rider paying with a Quicksilver or QuicksilverOne card will receive a 20% credit on their statement for any ride taken through April 30, 2016. The credit will be valid on all Uber rides paid for in USD and will be applied to your card statement in 1-2 billing cycles.

No need to add a promo code for this credit; as long as you're using your Quicksilver or QuicksilverOne card to pay for the ride, you'll automatically receive the credit.
