In order to verify your payment method, we may issue a small authorization hold. This amount is never actually charged to your account, but you may see it as “pending”.

All authorization holds are voided within a few business days, depending on your bank’s policy.

We issue authorization holds as a way to better protect against fraud that may result from unauthorized card usage. If you would like to confirm a specific item on your statement, please contact your bank directly.
