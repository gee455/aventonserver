Any Uber rider paying with a Quicksilver or QuicksilverOne card will receive a 20% credit on their card statement on all rides taken through April 30, 2016.

The credit will be valid on all Uber rides paid for in USD and will be applied to your card statement in 1-2 billing cycles.

No need to add a promo code for this credit; as long as you're using your Quicksilver or QuicksilverOne card to pay for the ride, you'll automatically receive the credit.

If you believe this credit is missing from your statement and two cycles have passed, you can call Capital One at the number located on the back of your Quicksilver card for assistance.
