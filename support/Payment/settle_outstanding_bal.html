If a charge to your card is declined, your Uber account may end up with an outstanding balance which prevents you from taking more rides.

To settle an outstanding balance:

- Login at the link below
- Navigate to “Payments” to add or update your payment methods
- Navigate to “My Trips”

You will then be prompted to charge the balance to the payment method of your choice.
