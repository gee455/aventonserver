You can change your default gratuity percentage for uberTAXI trips by signing in at the link below. This setting will only apply in cities where uberTAXI is offered and does not affect fares on other products such as uberX or UberBLACK.

To change your default uberTAXI gratuity amount:
- Navigate to “Payment”
- Select your preferred gratuity percentage from the dropdown menu

Please note: the gratuity you select will apply to all future taxi trips that you request and pay for through Uber. It will not affect uberT trips, where in-app payment is not supported.

Remember, there is no need to tip on other Uber services.
